Code quality:
- Prefix private methods with '_'
- Reorder methods in classes to have public methods last

Stylesheets:
- Optimize all css selectors with '>' where possible
- Split css into separate files where possible
- Cleanup stylus files to be more params-based

Views:
- Avoid re-creating all EntryViews on view mode changes
- Prettier routes for all feeds in each category (#category/3/all)
- Implement "extra tools" slide-in bar
- Implement progress indicator
- Investigate bootstrapping categories and feeds with an in-page json
  instead of the extra ajax call
- Load entries incrementally with infinite scrolling

Server:
- Implement mock auth infra
