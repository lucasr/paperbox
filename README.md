What is it?
===========

Paperbox is a sketch/prototype of a news reading web app written in
CoffeeScript using Jade, Stylus, and Express. The code currently only includes
the front-end side using mock backend.

I envisioned Paperbox as a minimalist clutter-free approach to news reading.
The greyscale UI is meant to keep the focus on the content and avoid visual
distractions. It has a few handy keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation.

Feel free to share your impressions.

I've written this more than a year ago. I used the latest versions of the
dependencies at that time - which are probably very old for now.
